# CoMaS-Carleton
CoMaS client setup, no eula, no tos. Can't say it's illegal to redistrubite if there's nothing saying against it.

From what I've looked into it so far CoMaS-Launcher-0.7.5, downloads a exam.ini file and a login.ini file, then downloads CoMaS-0.7.4g...

which is in login.ini (line 127), version=0.7.4g


... more later
